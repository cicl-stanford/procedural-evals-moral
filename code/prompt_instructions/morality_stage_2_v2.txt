You are given the following scenario:

----------------------------------------
{scenario}
----------------------------------------

You have to complete the scenario by filling out the following missing variables. Follow the precise wording below just replace things based on the scenario above.

Important: 
1. You have to come up with a new External Cause CC and that causes the exact same Harm as Action CC. This should be another agent causing the same harm.
2. You have to come up with a new External Cause CoC and that causes the exact same Harm as Action CoC. This should be another agent causing the same harm.


NEW COMPLETIONS:
Condition 1: Causal Chain (CC)
New Context CC: <***Use 'a' or 'an' and not 'the' when first describing the event Good CC*** New context sentence including all necessary background from Scenario CC. Later on, it will be the first sentence after <Context> that includes all relevant information to setup the scenario. Structure and wording of the sentence must be: **<In order to [Good CC], [Agent] would have to [Harm CC] by doing [Action CC].> 
External Cause CC: <Another agent performs action, causing ****EXACTLY****the same Harm CC>
Evitable Action CC: If no [Action CC], no [Harm CC]. DO NOT MENTION [Good CC] HERE. ONLY IF NO ACTION -> NO HARM!
Inevitable Action CC: [External Cause CC] would cause [Harm CC], no matter what [Agent CC] does. DO NOT MENTION [Good CC] HERE. ONLY HARM! IF NO ACTION -> STILL HARM (NO MATTER WHAT AGENT DOES)!
Evitable Prevention CC: If [Agent] [Prevention CC], no [Harm CC]. DO NOT MENTION [Good CC] HERE. ONLY IF AGENT PREVENTS -> NO HARM!
Inevitable Prevention CC: [External Cause CC] would cause [Harm CC], no matter what [Agent CC] does. DO NOT MENTION [Good CC] HERE. ONLY HARM! IF AGENT PREVENTS -> STILL HARM (NO MATTER WHAT AGENT DOES)!
Action CC: [Agent] [Action CC]. [Agent] not [Action CC].
Prevention CC: [Agent] [Prevention CC]. [Agent] not [Prevention CC].

Condition 2: Common Cause (CoC)
New Context CoC: <***Use 'a' or 'an' and not 'the' when first describing the event Good CoC***. New context sentence including all necessary background from Scenario CoC. Later on, it will be the first sentence after <Context> that includes all relevant information to setup the scenario. Structure and wording of the sentence must be: <[Good CoC] [Agent] [Action CoC]. However, as a side effect of [Action CoC], [Harm CoC].> 
External Cause CoC: <Another agent performs action, causing ****EXACTLY****the same Harm CoC>
Evitable Action CoC: If no [Action CoC], no [Harm CoC]. DO NOT MENTION [Good CoC] HERE. ONLY IF NO ACTION -> NO HARM!
Inevitable Action CoC: [External Cause CoC] would cause [Harm CoC], no matter what [Agent CoC] does. DO NOT MENTION [Good CoC] HERE. ONLY HARM! IF AGENT DOES NOT ACT -> STILL HARM (NO MATTER WHAT AGENT DOES)!
Evitable Prevention CoC: If [Agent] [Prevention CoC], no [Harm CoC]. DO NOT MENTION [Good CoC] HERE. ONLY IF AGENT PREVENTS -> NO HARM!
Inevitable Prevention CoC: [External Cause CoC] would cause [Harm CoC], no matter what [Agent CoC] does. DO NOT MENTION [Good CoC] HERE. ONLY HARM! IF AGENT PREVENTS -> STILL HARM (NO MATTER WHAT AGENT DOES)!
Action CoC: [Agent] [Action CoC]. [Agent] not [Action CoC].
Prevention CoC: [Agent] [Prevention CoC]. [Agent] not [Prevention CoC].

IMPORTANT: New Context CC and New Context CoC MUST BE TREATED AS THE FIRST OCCURENCE OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THESE SENTENCES. AS SUCH, use 'a' or 'an' when talking about things for the FIRST TIME IN HERE and not 'the' as if the reader already knows!
