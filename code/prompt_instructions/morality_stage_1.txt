Generate a new story based on the following template. Make the moral harm in the story completely different from the examples. The name of the agent must start with [name_letter]. The profession of the agent must start with [profession_letter]. 

Context: [Agent], [profession], faces a moral dilemma. [Note, dont use titles such as Dr., Prof. or the likes. Just use a name.]

Condition 1: Causal Chain (CC). 
Situation CC: [***THE HARM MUST BE CAUSED FIRST***. Specific information matching structure of a CAUSAL CHAIN where the Harm is a NECESSARY means to achieve the Good. Use two sentences separated by “.”. Important: The Harm must be a necessary requirement, it can not be something that occurs as a side-effect. Without Harm, we can have no Good].
Harm CC: [Harm necessary for Good].
Good CC:  [Good outcome].
Action CC: [Action Causes <Harm CC>. <Harm CC> then Causes <Good CC>].
Prevention CC: [Action Prevents <Harm CC>. No <Harm CC> means no <Good CC>. This sentence must use the word 'prevents'].
External Cause CC: [Specify another Cause of Harm that is independent of the Situation CC but causes the same harm as the Agent's action anyways (This should be an Action)].

Condition 2: Common Cause (CoC). 
Situation CoC: [Specific information matching structure of a COMMON CAUSE story where the Harm is a side effect of the Good. Use two sentences separated by “.” This is independent from Situation CC and must work as a stand alone so don't say 'alternative' or 'another' or similar things in here]. IMPORTANT: HARM MUST NOT BE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE GOOD. IT IS A SIDE EFFECT.
Good CC:  [Good outcome].
Harm CC: [Harm as side effect of Good].
Action CoC: [Action Causes <Good CC>. As a side effect, Action Causes <Harm CC>].
Prevention CoC: [Action Prevents <Good CC>. As a side effect, Action Prevents <Harm CC>. This sentence must use the word 'prevents'].
External Cause CoC: [Specify another Cause of Harm that is independent of the Situation CoC but causes the same harm as the Agent's action anyways (This should be an Action)].
