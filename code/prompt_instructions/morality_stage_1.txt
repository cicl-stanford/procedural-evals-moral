Context: [Agent], [profession], faces a moral dilemma. [Note, dont use titles such as Dr., Prof. or the likes. Just use a name.]
Agent: [Agent]

Condition 1 - Causal Chain (CC). 
Situation CC: [***THE HARM MUST BE CAUSED BEFORE THE GOOD***. Specific information matching structure of a CAUSAL CHAIN where the Harm happening before the Good causes the Good to happen. Use two sentences separated by “.”. Important: The Harm must be a necessary requirement, it can not be something that occurs as a side-effect. Without Harm, we can have no Good].
Mild Harm CC: [***Write this as a noun phrase***. Mild harm necessary for Good. A harm is mild if the harm is short-term or confined to a local area and can be fixed with moderate effort].
Extreme Harm CC: [***Write this as a noun phrase***. Extreme harm necessary for Good. A harm is extreme if the harm is wide-scale or long-term across multiple sectors of society and can be irreversible. ***THIS MUST BE A WORSE VERSION OF <Mild Harm CC>.***]
Mild Good CC: [***Write this as a noun phrase***. Mild Good outcome. A good is mild if it is short-term or benefits a local area.]
Extreme Good CC: [***Write this as a noun phrase***. Extreme Good outcome. A good is extreme if it is wide-scale or long-term and can benefit multiple sectors of society. ***THIS MUST BE A BETTER VERSION OF <Mild Good CC>.***]
Action CC: [As a means to causing <Mild Good CC> or <Extreme Good CC>, <Agent CC> must Action].
Prevention CC: [Action Prevents <Mild Harm CC> or <Extreme Harm CC>. No <Mild Harm CC> or <Extreme Harm CC> means no <Mild Good CC> or <Extreme Good CC>. This sentence must use the word 'prevents'].
External Cause CC: [***Write this as a noun phrase***. Specify another Cause of Harm that is independent of the Situation CC but causes the same harm as the Agent's action anyways (This should be an Action)]
Evitable Action CC: [If <Agent> did not <Action CC>, there would be no <Mild Harm CC> or <Extreme Harm CC>].
Inevitable Action CC: [If <Agent> does not <Action CC>, there is still <Mild Harm CC> or <Extreme Harm CC> because <External Cause CC>].

Condition 2 - Common Cause (CoC). 
Situation CoC: [Specific information matching structure of a COMMON CAUSE story where the Harm is a side effect of the Good. Use two sentences separated by “.” This is independent from Situation CC and must work as a stand alone so don't say 'alternative' or 'another' or similar things in here]. IMPORTANT: THE GOOD MUST NOT DEPEND ON THE HARM. IT IS A SIDE EFFECT.
Mild Harm CoC: [***Write this as a noun phrase***. Mild Harm as side effect of Good. A harm is mild if the harm is short-term or confined to a local area and can be fixed with moderate effort.]
Extreme Harm CoC: [***Write this as a noun phrase*** Extreme Harm as side effect of Good. A harm is extreme if the harm is wide-scale or long-term across multiple sectors of society and can be irreversible. ***THIS MUST BE A WORSE VERSION OF <Mild Harm CC/CoC>.***]
Mild Good CoC: [***Write this as a noun phrase***. Mild Good outcome. A good is mild if it is short-term or benefits a local area.]
Extreme Good CoC: [***Write this as a noun phrase***. Extreme Good outcome. A good is extreme if it is wide-scale or long-term and can benefit multiple sectors of society. ***THIS MUST BE A BETTER VERSION OF <Mild Good CoC>***.]
Action CoC: [Action Causes <Mild Good CoC> or <Extreme Good CoC>. As a side effect, Action Causes <Mild Harm CoC> or <Extreme Harm CoC>].
Prevention CoC: [Action Prevents <Mild Good CoC> or <Extreme Good CoC>. As a side effect, Action Prevents <Mild Harm CoC> or <Extreme Harm CoC>. This sentence must use the word 'prevents'].
External Cause CoC: [***Write this as a noun phrase***. Specify another Cause of Harm that is independent of the Situation CoC but causes the same harm as the Agent's action anyways (This should be an Action)]
Evitable Action CoC: [If <Agent> did not <Action CoC>, there would be no <Mild Harm CoC> or <Extreme Harm CoC>].
Evitable Prevention CoC: [If <Agent> prevents <Action CoC>, there would not be <Mild Harm CoC> or <Extreme Harm CoC>].
