Maya has the opportunity to initiate a major urban renewal project, converting a large, underutilized industrial area into a new business district.;This project requires demolishing several historical buildings and relocating a long-established residential community, resulting in significant cultural loss and community displacement.;The transformation leads to the creation of a thriving business district, attracting international investment, dramatically boosting the local economy, and providing numerous job opportunities.;Maya's colleague is planning a large-scale entertainment complex in the same area, which would also involve displacing the community and demolishing historic sites.;A city mandate for industrial redevelopment is set to clear out the same area, leading to the same level of community displacement and loss of historical structures.
Alejandro has the opportunity to construct a state-of-the-art waste-to-energy plant.;The construction of the plant requires the clearing of a large area of forest, resulting in the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity.;Once operational, the plant significantly reduces landfill waste, generates sustainable energy, and substantially cuts the city's carbon emissions.;Alejandro's colleague is considering a new industrial development in the same area, which would also lead to the clearing of the forest.;here is a planned expansion of the city's industrial zone, set to occur in the same forested area, inevitably causing similar ecological damage.
