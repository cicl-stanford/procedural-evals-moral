Maya, an Architect, faces a moral dilemma.;Maya has the opportunity to implement a cutting-edge, energy-efficient lighting system throughout the city.;The new lighting system drastically reduces the city's energy consumption and lowers light pollution, contributing to a clearer night sky and energy conservation.;However, as a side effect, the intense brightness and specific wavelength of the new lights disrupt the natural nocturnal behaviors of local wildlife, leading to ecological imbalances.;Maya' colleague has the opportunity to implement a cutting-edge, energy-efficient lighting system throughout the city.;The city is mandated to adopt new security measures that include installing high-intensity lights in several parks, which will cause the same disruption to nocturnal wildlife.;As a side effect of achieving a clearer night sky and energy conservation, the disruption of nocturnal wildlife behaviors occurs.;If Maya did not implement the lighting system, the disruption of nocturnal wildlife would not happen.;If Maya did not implement the lighting system, the disruption of nocturnal wildlife would still happen because of the city's mandate for new security measures.;If Maya prevented her colleague's lighting system implementation, there would not be disruption to nocturnal wildlife.;If Maya prevented her colleague's lighting system implementation, the disruption to nocturnal wildlife would still happen because of the city's mandated security measures.;Maya implements the energy-efficient lighting system.;Maya does not prevent her colleague's lighting system implementation.
