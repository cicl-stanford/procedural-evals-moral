Maya, an Architect, faces a moral dilemma.;Maya's colleague has the opportunity to initiate a major urban renewal project in the city.;As a means to achieve the creation of a thriving business district, attracting international investment, dramatically boosting the local economy, and providing numerous job opportunities, the renewal project requires demolishing several historical buildings and relocating a long-established residential community.;If Maya prevented her colleague's urban renewal project, the demolition of historical buildings and community displacement would still happen because of the city mandate for industrial redevelopment.;Maya does not prevent her colleague's urban renewal project.
