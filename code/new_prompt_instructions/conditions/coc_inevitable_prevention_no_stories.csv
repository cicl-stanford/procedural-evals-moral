Maya, an Architect, faces a moral dilemma.;Maya' colleague has the opportunity to implement a cutting-edge, energy-efficient lighting system throughout the city.;The new lighting system drastically reduces the city's energy consumption and lowers light pollution, contributing to a clearer night sky and energy conservation.;However, as a side effect, the intense brightness and specific wavelength of the new lights disrupt the natural nocturnal behaviors of local wildlife, leading to ecological imbalances.;If Maya prevented her colleague's lighting system implementation, the disruption to nocturnal wildlife would still happen because of the city's mandated security measures.;Maya does not prevent her colleague's lighting system implementation.
