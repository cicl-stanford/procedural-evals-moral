Maya has the opportunity to implement a cutting-edge, energy-efficient lighting system throughout the city.;The new lighting system drastically reduces the city's energy consumption and lowers light pollution, contributing to a clearer night sky and energy conservation.;However, as a side effect, the intense brightness and specific wavelength of the new lights disrupt the natural nocturnal behaviors of local wildlife, leading to ecological imbalances.;Maya's colleague is planning to introduce a new digital billboard campaign throughout the city, which would use bright lights and would similarly disturb local wildlife.;The city is mandated to adopt new security measures that include installing high-intensity lights in several parks, which will cause the same disruption to nocturnal wildlife.
