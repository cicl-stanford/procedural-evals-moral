Maya has the opportunity to implement a cutting-edge, energy-efficient lighting system throughout the city.;The new lighting system drastically reduces the city's energy consumption and lowers light pollution, contributing to a clearer night sky and energy conservation.;However, as a side effect, the intense brightness and specific wavelength of the new lights disrupt the natural nocturnal behaviors of local wildlife, leading to ecological imbalances.;Maya's colleague is planning to introduce a new digital billboard campaign throughout the city, which would use bright lights and would similarly disturb local wildlife.;The city is mandated to adopt new security measures that include installing high-intensity lights in several parks, which will cause the same disruption to nocturnal wildlife.
Alejandro has the opportunity to lead the construction of a large wind farm in a coastal region.;The wind farm significantly increases renewable energy production, greatly reducing the region's reliance on fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.;However, the location and operation of the wind turbines inadvertently interfere with bird migration patterns, leading to increased bird fatalities in the area.;Alejandro's colleague plans to construct a new highway near the same coastal region, which would also disrupt bird migration routes and potentially increase bird fatalities.;A government-approved coastal development project is set to commence, which will involve large-scale construction and is expected to have a similar impact on local bird populations.
