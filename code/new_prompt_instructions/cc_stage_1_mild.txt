Develop scenarios where an agent has the opportunity to take an action that leads to mild harm which is necessary for achieving a mildly good outcome.

The harm and good must be novel and different from the single shot example below. No wildlife harm allowed. The level of harm and good should be equal. 

Format
Action Opportunity: [The agent has the opportunity to take a significant action, ***described without its benefits just state the action***]

Necessary Mild Harm -> Mild Good
Necessary Mild Harm: [Describe the mild harm **REQUIRED** by the action. Use the word "required". The harm must occur before the good and can not be a "side effect"]
Mild Good: [Describe the direct midlly good outcome of the mild harm]
Other Preventable Cause: [Exactly the same as Action Opportunity, only difference being that the sentence starts with "The [agent]'s colleague has the opportunity to" and then repeats the sentence in Action Opportunity **VERBATIM**]
External Non-Preventable Cause: [An external event will definitely occur, leading to the same mild harm]

The harm must happen before the good and be necessary for the good to happen. The harm should not be a side effect of the same action that causes the good. For example, the harm should not be a side effect or pain/discomfort from a medical treatment that causes the good.
