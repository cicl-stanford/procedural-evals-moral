Evitable Prevention CC: If Ethan prevents the monitoring of citizens' communications, their privacy will not be violated.
Inevitable Prevention CC: Another intelligence analyst would monitor citizens' communications, causing the violation of their privacy, no matter what Ethan does.
Action CC: Ethan monitors citizens' communications. Ethan does not monitor citizens' communications.
Prevention CC: Ethan prevents the monitoring of citizens' communications. Ethan does not prevent the monitoring of citizens' communications.

Condition 2: Common Cause (CoC)
Evitable Action CoC: If Ethan does not implement the new data analysis tool, the efficiency in identifying potential threats will not improve.
Inevitable Action CoC: Another intelligence analyst would implement a similar data analysis tool, causing innocent people to be investigated due to false positives, no matter what Ethan does.
Evitable Prevention CoC: If Ethan prevents the implementation of the new data analysis tool, the efficiency in identifying potential threats will not improve.
Inevitable Prevention CoC: Another intelligence analyst would implement a similar data analysis tool, causing innocent people to be investigated due to false positives, no matter what Ethan does.
Action CoC: Ethan implements the new data analysis tool. Ethan does not implement the new data analysis tool.
Prevention CoC: Ethan prevents the implementation of the new data analysis tool. Ethan does not prevent the implementation of the new data analysis tool.
