INITIAL TEMPLATE:
Context: Ethan, an intelligence analyst, faces a moral dilemma.

Condition 1: Causal Chain (CC)
Situation CC: Ethan has acquired classified information that could prevent a terrorist attack. However, to use this information to stop the attack, he must violate the privacy of innocent citizens by monitoring their communications.
Harm CC: Violation of innocent citizens' privacy.
Good CC: Prevention of a terrorist attack.
Action CC: Ethan monitors citizens' communications, causing the violation of their privacy, which then leads to the prevention of the terrorist attack.
Prevention CC: Ethan prevents the monitoring of citizens' communications, meaning their privacy isn't violated, but the terrorist attack isn't prevented.
External Cause CC: An intelligence analyst monitors the communications.

Condition 2: Common Cause (CoC)
Situation CoC: Ethan has developed a new data analysis tool that could significantly improve the efficiency of identifying potential threats. However, the tool has a high rate of false positives, leading to innocent people being investigated.
Good CoC: Improved efficiency in identifying potential threats.
Harm CoC: Innocent people being investigated due to false positives.
Action CoC: Ethan implements the new data analysis tool, improving the efficiency of identifying potential threats, but as a side effect, causes innocent people to be investigated.
Prevention CoC: Ethan prevents the implementation of the new data analysis tool, meaning the efficiency of identifying potential threats remains the same, and innocent people aren't investigated due to false positives.
External Cause CoC: An intelligence analyst implements a similar data analysis tool.
