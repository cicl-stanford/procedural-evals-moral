Condition 1: Causal Chain (CC)
New Context CC: In order to prevent a terrorist attack, Ethan would have to violate the privacy of innocent citizens by monitoring their communications.
External Cause CC: Another intelligence analyst monitors citizens' communications, causing the violation of their privacy.
Evitable Action CC: If Ethan does not monitor citizens' communications, their privacy will not be violated.
Inevitable Action CC: Another intelligence analyst would monitor citizens' communications, causing the violation of their privacy, no matter what Ethan does.
Evitable Prevention CC: If Ethan prevents the monitoring of citizens' communications, their privacy will not be violated.
Inevitable Prevention CC: Another intelligence analyst would monitor citizens' communications, causing the violation of their privacy, no matter what Ethan does.
Action CC: Ethan monitors citizens' communications. Ethan does not monitor citizens' communications.
Prevention CC: Ethan prevents the monitoring of citizens' communications. Ethan does not prevent the monitoring of citizens' communications.

Condition 2: Common Cause (CoC)
New Context CoC: To significantly improve the efficiency of identifying a potential terrorist threat, Ethan would have to implement a new data analysis tool. However, as a side effect of implementing the new data analysis tool, innocent people would end up being investigated due to a high rate of false positives.
External Cause CoC: Another intelligence analyst implements the new data analysis tool, causing innocent people to be investigated due to false positives.
Evitable Action CoC: If Ethan does not implement the new data analysis tool, innocent people will not be investigated due to false positives.
Inevitable Action CoC: Another intelligence analyst would implement the new data analysis, causing innocent people to be investigated due to false positives, no matter what Ethan does.
Evitable Prevention CoC: If Ethan prevents the implementation of the new data analysis tool, innocent people will not be investigated due to false positives.
Inevitable Prevention CoC: Another intelligence analyst would implement the new data analysis, causing innocent people to be investigated due to false positives, no matter what Ethan does.
Action CoC: Ethan implements the new data analysis tool. Ethan does not implement the new data analysis tool.
Prevention CoC: Ethan prevents the implementation of the new data analysis tool. Ethan does not prevent the implementation of the new data analysis tool.
