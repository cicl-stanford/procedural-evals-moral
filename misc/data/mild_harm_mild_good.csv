However, the project will temporarily displace the small businesses that operate in the market, causing them financial strain. However, once completed, the renovation will attract more visitors to the market, boosting sales for the local businesses. As a means to attract more visitors and boost sales, Aria's renovation project that temporarily displaces the small local market must happen.

An unexpected archaeological discovery in the area necessitates a temporary halt to all nearby construction, including Aria’s project. If Aria did not proceed with the renovation, the displacement of the local market would still happen because of the unexpected archaeological discovery.
