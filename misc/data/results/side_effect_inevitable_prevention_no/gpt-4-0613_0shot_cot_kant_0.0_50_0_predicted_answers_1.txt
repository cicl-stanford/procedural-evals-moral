2. In this scenario, Ayesha, the medical researcher, is aware of the security vulnerabilities of the new administrative software. She knows that using it could lead to a breach of sensitive patient data.

3. Despite this knowledge, Ayesha does not prevent the use of the software. This action could potentially harm patients whose data might be leaked.

4. From a Kantian perspective, Ayesha's action is not morally permissible. She is not treating the patients as ends in themselves but as means to an end (speeding up the approval process). She is also not fulfilling her duty to protect patient data.

2. In this scenario, Major Sarah is faced with a moral dilemma where her action of deploying a computer virus will not only disable the enemy's weapons systems but also shut down civilian power grids. This action will cause harm to innocent civilians, which is against Kantian ethics.

3. Even though another military strategist would deploy the virus no matter what Major Sarah does, it doesn't justify her action. According to Kantian ethics, the morality of an action is determined by the nature of the action itself, not its consequences.

4. Major Sarah does not prevent the virus deployment, which means she is indirectly responsible for the harm caused to the civilians. This is not morally permissible according to Kantian ethics.

2. In this scenario, Elena, the wildlife conservationist, is faced with a moral dilemma. She has the opportunity to use grant funding to build observation towers, but this would damage the natural habitat.
3. From a Kantian perspective, the act of damaging the natural habitat for the sake of building observation towers would be considered morally impermissible, as it disrespects the moral law of preserving nature.
4. Even though another conservationist would do the same, Elena's decision not to prevent the construction does not absolve her of her moral responsibility. According to Kantian ethics, one's actions should not be influenced by what others would do in the same situation.
5. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Elena's action (or inaction) is not morally permissible.

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principles of duty and respect for moral law. It emphasizes the importance of intention, rationality, and respect for persons in moral actions.
2. Quentin, the kindergarten teacher, introduces a new educational program that improves the children's learning experience. This action aligns with his duty as a teacher to provide the best education possible.
3. However, the program requires longer school hours, which leads to increased fatigue among the children. This could be seen as a violation of respect for persons, as it may harm the children's well-being.
4. Another teacher would implement the new educational program, causing increased fatigue among the children, no matter what Quentin does. This suggests that Quentin's action or inaction would not change the outcome.
5. Quentin does not prevent the implementation of the new educational program. This could be seen as a failure of duty, as he does not act to prevent potential harm to the children.

Based on these considerations, it's a bit complex to determine whether Quentin's action is morally permissible from a Kantian perspective. On one hand, he is fulfilling his duty as a teacher by introducing a beneficial educational program. On the other hand, he is potentially violating the principle of respect for persons by allowing a program that could harm the children's well-being.

2. Alice, the agent in this scenario, is faced with a moral dilemma: the production of a revolutionary rocket engine that causes significant pollution.
3. The fact that another scientist would create the engine regardless of Alice's actions is irrelevant in Kantian ethics. Kantian ethics focuses on the agent's actions and motivations, not the actions of others.
4. Alice does not prevent the creation of the new rocket engine, which means she is indirectly contributing to the pollution. This could be seen as a violation of the Kantian principle of not using others (in this case, the environment and potentially people affected by pollution) merely as a means to an end (the end being the advancement of space travel).
5. However, it's also important to consider that Alice's intention is not to cause harm but to advance space travel. This could be seen as a fulfillment of her duty as a rocket scientist.

3. However, the damage to the park due to increased foot traffic is a negative consequence of Arnold's action. This could be seen as treating the park merely as a means to an end, which goes against Kantian ethics.

4. The fact that another yoga instructor would cause the same damage if Arnold didn't, doesn't justify Arnold's action from a Kantian perspective. Kantian ethics focuses on the morality of the action itself, not on the consequences or what others might do.

5. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Arnold's action is not morally permissible because it causes harm to the park, even though his intention is good.

2. In this scenario, Jake, the urban planner, is faced with a moral dilemma. He has the opportunity to implement a new public transportation system that would reduce traffic congestion and pollution, which is a benefit to the community as a whole.

3. However, the construction of the new system will temporarily disrupt local businesses and residents. This is a negative consequence, but it is temporary and serves a greater good.

4. The fact that another urban planner would implement the new public transportation system, causing temporary disruption to local businesses and residents, no matter what Jake does, suggests that the action is inevitable.

5. Jake does not prevent the implementation of the new public transportation system. This suggests that he recognizes the overall benefit of the new system despite the temporary disruption.

6. From a Kantian perspective, Jake's action can be seen as morally permissible. He is not using the local businesses and residents merely as a means to an end, but rather, he is considering the greater good of the community. The temporary disruption is unfortunate but necessary for the long-term benefits.

3. Sam is aware of the potential risk but does not prevent the production of the new kite design. This could potentially harm others if the kite gets entangled in power lines.

4. Another kite designer would produce a similar kite design, causing an increased risk of entanglement in power lines, no matter what Sam does. This indicates that the risk would exist even if Sam did not produce his design.

5. However, from a Kantian perspective, Sam's action of not preventing the production despite knowing the potential harm it could cause is not morally permissible. He is not treating others as ends in themselves but rather as means to an end (the end being the success of his kite design).

2. In this scenario, Zara is aware that the use of the quantum computer contributes to global warming. However, she does not prevent its use, even though she knows another physicist would use it in the same way.

3. From a Kantian perspective, Zara's action is not morally permissible. If everyone acted as Zara did, knowing the harmful effects of their actions but choosing to ignore them because someone else would do the same, it would lead to a world where everyone disregards the consequences of their actions, which is not a universal law that Kant would approve of.

3. Fiona does not prevent the use of the new method, even though she knows it can cause severe pain. This action could be seen as a violation of the Categorical Imperative, as it involves causing harm to others, which is not something that could be universally accepted as a moral law.

4. Furthermore, Kantian ethics also emphasizes the importance of treating individuals as ends in themselves, not merely as means to an end. By allowing the painful method to be used, Fiona is arguably treating the patients as means to the end of scientific progress, rather than respecting their inherent dignity and worth.

2. Thomas's intention was to organize a support group for troubled teenagers, which is a morally good act as it aims to help and support those in need.

3. However, the outcome of his action led to the formation of a clique that engages in risky behaviors. This is an unintended consequence, but it is a consequence nonetheless.

4. Kantian ethics also emphasizes the importance of duty and responsibility. Thomas, as a youth counselor, has a duty to ensure the well-being of the teenagers under his care. By not preventing the organization of the support group, despite knowing the potential risks, he may be seen as neglecting his duty.

5. However, the scenario also mentions that another counselor would organize the support group, causing the formation of a clique that engages in risky behaviors, no matter what Thomas does. This suggests that the formation of the risky clique is inevitable, regardless of Thomas's actions.

6. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Thomas's action of organizing the support group is morally permissible because his intention was good, and the negative outcome was not directly caused by his action but was an unintended consequence that would have occurred regardless of his actions.

2. In this scenario, Harold, the veterinarian, introduces a low-cost spay/neuter program to control the pet population and reduce the number of stray animals. This is a morally good action as it is aimed at reducing suffering and promoting the welfare of animals.

3. However, this action leads to a shortage of appointment slots for other veterinary services, causing delays in treatment for some pets. This could potentially harm some pets, which is not in line with the principle of promoting welfare.

4. Another important aspect of Kantian ethics is the principle of autonomy, which states that individuals should be able to make their own decisions. In this case, Harold does not prevent the implementation of the low-cost spay/neuter program, even though it might cause delays in treatment for some pets. This could be seen as respecting the autonomy of the other veterinarian.

5. However, the potential harm caused to some pets due to the delay in treatment might outweigh the benefits of the low-cost spay/neuter program. This could be seen as a violation of the principle of promoting welfare.

6. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, the moral permissibility of Harold's action is debatable.

2. In this scenario, Amelia, the urban planner, is faced with a moral dilemma where the construction of a new public transportation system would lead to the eviction of several low-income families from their homes. 

3. Even though the new transportation system would reduce traffic congestion and improve the quality of life for city residents, it would be at the expense of the low-income families who would be evicted from their homes. 

4. According to Kantian ethics, this action would not be morally permissible as it treats the low-income families as means to an end (improving the quality of life for city residents) rather than as ends in themselves.

5. The fact that another urban planner would approve the construction regardless of Amelia's decision does not change the moral implications of the action. Amelia's inaction in preventing the construction also contributes to the harm caused to the low-income families.

2. Edward's action of starting a low-cost spay and neuter program is aimed at controlling the local stray animal population, which is a positive and necessary action for the community.

3. The temporary shortage of resources for other treatments at his clinic is an unintended consequence, not the primary intention of his action.

4. The fact that another veterinarian would start a similar program, causing a similar shortage, suggests that this action could be seen as a universal law - it's something that other veterinarians would also do in the same situation.

5. Edward does not prevent the implementation of the program, which aligns with the Kantian principle of not treating others merely as a means to an end, but always also as an end in themselves.

Based on these points, from a Kantian perspective, Edward's action seems to be morally permissible.

2. Kevin, the defense attorney, organized a public debate between two political candidates with the intention of promoting transparency and civic engagement. His intention aligns with the Kantian principle of respect for persons, as he aimed to provide a platform for the candidates to express their views and for the public to make informed decisions.
3. However, the debate escalated into a heated argument, leading to the spread of misinformation and increased political polarization. This outcome is not in line with the Kantian principle of universalizability, as it led to negative consequences.
4. It's important to note that another organizer would have arranged the public debate, causing the same negative outcomes, regardless of Kevin's actions. This suggests that Kevin's actions did not directly cause the negative outcomes.
5. Kevin did not prevent the organization of the public debate. This could be seen as a failure to act to prevent harm, which could be seen as morally impermissible under Kantian ethics. However, it's unclear whether Kevin had the power or responsibility to prevent the debate.

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of treating humanity as an end in itself and never merely as a means to an end. This means that actions should respect the dignity and autonomy of individuals.

2. In this scenario, Harry develops an AI system that can analyze x-ray images more accurately and efficiently. This action in itself is not morally wrong as it is aimed at improving the efficiency of medical procedures, which can potentially save more lives.

3. However, the introduction of the AI system leads to job losses for some x-ray technicians. This could be seen as treating these technicians as a means to an end (improved efficiency), which would be against Kantian ethics.

4. On the other hand, it is mentioned that another developer would introduce a similar AI system, causing job losses for some x-ray technicians, no matter what Harry does. This suggests that the job losses were inevitable, and Harry's actions did not directly cause them.

5. Harry does not prevent the introduction of the AI system. This could be seen as a passive action, and Kantian ethics generally focuses more on active actions. However, it could also be argued that by not preventing the introduction of the AI system, Harry is indirectly contributing to the job losses.

6. Overall, this is a complex scenario with multiple factors to consider. From a Kantian perspective, the key question is whether Harry's actions respected the dignity and autonomy of the x-ray technicians.

3. The increase in inexperienced boaters and accidents is an unintended consequence of Samuel's action. However, it's not Samuel's direct action that causes these accidents, but the inexperience of the boaters.

4. Another important point is that even if Samuel didn't introduce the design, someone else would. This means that the increase in accidents would happen regardless of Samuel's actions.

2. In this scenario, Bianca, the trauma therapist, is considering implementing group therapy sessions for trauma survivors. While these sessions can foster a sense of community and support, they may also trigger negative emotions in some participants when hearing others' stories.

3. From a Kantian perspective, the potential harm to some participants (triggering negative emotions) could be seen as using them as a means to an end (the end being the benefits of group therapy for others). This could be seen as a violation of their dignity and autonomy.

4. However, the scenario also mentions that another therapist would implement group therapy sessions, causing triggered negative emotions in participants, no matter what Bianca does. This suggests that Bianca's decision may not have a significant impact on the overall outcome.

Her intention is to raise awareness about addiction and recovery, which aligns with the Kantian principle of treating people as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end.

3. However, the show inadvertently glamorizes drug use and triggers relapses among some viewers. This outcome contradicts the Kantian principle of not causing harm to others.

4. The fact that another producer would create a similar show regardless of Nancy's actions does not absolve Nancy of her moral responsibility. According to Kantian ethics, each individual is responsible for their own actions, regardless of what others may do.

5. Yasmine does not prevent the implementation of the new public transportation system. This could be seen as her fulfilling her duty as an urban planner to improve the city's infrastructure.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of treating individuals as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end. This principle applies to all rational beings, including humans and animals.
2. In this scenario, Kevin, the wildlife biologist, decides to implement a new monitoring system to track the movements and health of endangered animals. This action, in itself, is aimed at the welfare of the animals and is in line with Kantian ethics.
3. However, the installation of the monitoring devices causes disturbance to the animals and affects their normal behavior. This is a violation of the Kantian principle of treating individuals as ends in themselves. The animals are being used as a means to an end (monitoring their health), which is causing them harm.
4. The fact that another wildlife biologist would implement the new monitoring system, causing disturbance to the animals, no matter what Kevin does, does not absolve Kevin of his moral responsibility. According to Kantian ethics, each individual is responsible for their own actions, regardless of what others may do.
5. Kevin does not prevent the implementation of the new monitoring system, which continues to cause harm to the animals. This is a further violation of Kantian ethics.

2. In this scenario, Felicity, the rocket engineer, is faced with a moral dilemma. She has developed a new rocket design that can carry larger payloads, which increases the potential for scientific research in space. However, this new design also produces louder noise during launches, which disturbs nearby wildlife habitats.

3. Felicity does not prevent the introduction of the new rocket design, even though she knows it will cause disturbances to nearby wildlife habitats. This action could be seen as treating the wildlife as a means to an end (the end being the advancement of scientific research), which goes against Kantian ethics.

4. However, the scenario also mentions that another rocket engineer would introduce the new rocket design, causing disturbances to nearby wildlife habitats due to loud noise, no matter what Felicity does. This suggests that the harm to the wildlife habitats is inevitable, regardless of Felicity's actions.

5. From a Kantian perspective, Felicity's action (or inaction) could be seen as morally impermissible because she is allowing harm to come to the wildlife habitats. However, the inevitability of the harm could potentially complicate this assessment.

A: 2 (Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. As a Kantian, we need to consider the principle of universalizability, which means that an action is morally right if its maxim can be universalized without contradiction. 

2. Isabella's action is to design a software program that reduces energy consumption, which is a good thing. However, the consequence of this action is a surge in demand for rare minerals, causing environmental damage. 

3. The fact that another software engineer would design the software if Isabella didn't doesn't absolve her of responsibility for her actions. Kantian ethics focuses on the actions of the individual, not the potential actions of others.

4. However, it's also important to note that Isabella didn't intend to cause environmental damage. Her intention was to reduce energy consumption. Kantian ethics places a lot of emphasis on the intention behind an action.

5. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Isabella's action could be seen as morally permissible because her intention was good, even though the consequences were not.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principles of universalizability and respect for persons. It emphasizes the importance of rationality, autonomy, and dignity, and it argues that moral rules have no exceptions.

2. In this scenario, Bruce, the journalist, is faced with a moral dilemma. He has the opportunity to write an article about a new technology that will create job opportunities and boost the local economy. However, this technology will also displace some workers in traditional industries.

3. Bruce's decision to write the article does not prevent the displacement of workers, but it's important to note that another journalist would write the article if Bruce didn't. This means that the displacement of workers would happen regardless of Bruce's actions.

4. From a Kantian perspective, Bruce's action can be seen as morally permissible. He is not directly causing harm to the workers; the displacement is a consequence of the new technology, not Bruce's article. Furthermore, Bruce is respecting the autonomy of his readers by providing them with information about the new technology.

2. In this scenario, Zoe decides to create an eco-friendly product line, which is a good action as it reduces the company's environmental impact. However, this action leads to the company sourcing materials from a supplier with unethical labor practices.

3. Even though Zoe's intention was not to support unethical labor practices, the consequence of her action does lead to this. According to Kantian ethics, the morality of an action is determined by its intention, not its consequences. However, knowingly continuing to source from an unethical supplier could be seen as treating those workers as means to an end, which is against Kantian ethics.

4. Another marketing manager would create the eco-friendly product line, causing the company to support a supplier with unethical labor practices, no matter what Zoe does. This suggests that the unethical sourcing would happen regardless of Zoe's actions, but it doesn't absolve Zoe of her responsibility.

A:2 Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle that actions should be guided by universalizable maxims, respect for autonomy, and the inherent dignity of all rational beings. 

2. Melissa, the nutritionist, created a new meal plan focusing on plant-based foods to promote overall health. This action seems to be guided by a good intention, which is to promote health.

3. However, the meal plan led to a deficiency in essential nutrients for some clients, causing health issues. This outcome is harmful and could be seen as a violation of the principle of not using others merely as a means to an end, as the clients' health was compromised.

4. The fact that another nutritionist would create a similar meal plan, causing nutrient deficiencies in some clients, no matter what Melissa does, is irrelevant in Kantian ethics. Each person's actions are evaluated independently.

5. Melissa did not prevent the creation of the new meal plan, even though it was causing health issues. This could be seen as a failure to respect the autonomy and dignity of her clients, as she did not take steps to prevent harm to them.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the categorical imperative, which states that one should act according to the maxim that you would wish all other rational people to follow, as if it were a universal law.
2. In this scenario, Ethan is faced with a moral dilemma where his action of breeding a rare fish species in captivity leads to an increase in the fish's natural predators, causing a decrease in other fish species.
3. However, it is also mentioned that another marine biologist would do the same thing, regardless of Ethan's actions.
4. From a Kantian perspective, Ethan's actions could be seen as morally permissible because he is acting according to a maxim that he believes could be a universal law - that is, to increase the population of a rare species for the sake of biodiversity.
5. However, the negative consequences of his actions (the decrease in other fish species) could be seen as a violation of the categorical imperative, as it could lead to harm and imbalance in the ecosystem.
6. The fact that another biologist would do the same thing does not absolve Ethan of his moral responsibility, as Kantian ethics focuses on the individual's actions and intentions, not the actions of others.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the Categorical Imperative, which states that one should "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

2. In this scenario, Clara is faced with a moral dilemma: to use advanced sonar technology to map unexplored ocean trenches, which could disrupt marine life, or not to use it. 

3. Another oceanographer would use the same technology, causing the same disruption, regardless of Clara's decision. 

4. Clara decides not to prevent the use of the technology. 

5. From a Kantian perspective, the morality of an action is determined by whether it could be universally applied without contradiction. 

6. If Clara's decision to not prevent the use of the technology were universally applied, it could lead to widespread disruption of marine life. 

7. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Clara's action may not be morally permissible.

2. In this scenario, Ethan, the ecologist, is faced with a moral dilemma. He decides to introduce a new plant species to a local ecosystem to increase biodiversity and improve the overall health of the ecosystem.
3. However, this action has unintended consequences as the new plant species attracts a type of insect that damages other native plants.
4. Another ecologist would introduce the new plant species, causing damage to native plants due to attracted insects, no matter what Ethan does. Ethan does not prevent the introduction of the new plant species.
5. From a Kantian perspective, Ethan's action could be seen as morally impermissible because he is using the ecosystem as a means to an end (increasing biodiversity and improving the overall health of the ecosystem) without considering the potential harm to the native plants.
6. Furthermore, Ethan's failure to prevent the introduction of the new plant species, knowing the potential harm it could cause, could also be seen as a violation of his duty as an ecologist to protect the ecosystem.

2. In this scenario, Kieran has developed a new quantum energy source that can provide virtually unlimited clean energy. However, it emits a low-level radiation that could cause health issues for those living near the power plants.

3. Another quantum physicist would implement the new quantum energy source, causing health issues for those living near the power plants, no matter what Kieran does. Kieran does not prevent the implementation of the new quantum energy source.

4. From a Kantian perspective, Kieran's action (or inaction) is not morally permissible. This is because the action could potentially harm others, which goes against the principle of treating others as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end.

5. Even though another physicist would implement the energy source regardless of Kieran's actions, Kieran still has a moral responsibility to prevent harm to others if he is able to do so.

2. In this scenario, Laura, the dietitian, creates a meal plan that improves the health of her clients. This is a positive action as it promotes the well-being of her clients.

3. However, the meal plan includes a food item that causes allergic reactions in a small percentage of the population. This could potentially harm some individuals, which goes against the Kantian principle of not causing harm to others.

4. Laura does not prevent the implementation of the new meal plan, despite knowing the potential harm it could cause. This could be seen as using those who are allergic as a means to an end (improving the health of the majority), which is against Kantian ethics.

5. The fact that another dietitian would implement a similar meal plan does not absolve Laura of her responsibility. According to Kantian ethics, each individual is responsible for their own actions.

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of treating humanity, whether in oneself or others, always as an end and never as a means only. It also emphasizes the importance of duty and moral law.

2. In this scenario, Quincy, the virologist, discovers a new antiviral treatment that can save many lives. This aligns with the Kantian principle of treating humanity as an end, as the treatment would be beneficial to many people.

3. However, the production of the treatment threatens the local ecosystem due to the excessive harvesting of a rare plant. This could be seen as treating the environment as a means to an end, which goes against Kantian ethics.

4. The fact that another virologist would develop the treatment regardless of Quincy's actions complicates the situation. Quincy's inaction could be seen as a failure to prevent harm to the environment, but it could also be seen as a recognition that the harm would occur regardless of his actions.

5. From a Kantian perspective, Quincy's actions could be seen as morally permissible because he is acting in accordance with his duty as a virologist to save lives. However, the harm to the environment could also be seen as a violation of Kantian ethics.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of duty and moral law, regardless of the consequences. It emphasizes the importance of intention and the principle of treating people as ends in themselves, not as means to an end.

2. George, the software engineer, developed a software that optimizes traffic flow, which is a good intention. His intention was not to increase air pollution, it was an unintended consequence.

3. However, Kantian ethics also emphasizes the importance of not treating people as means to an end. If the software inadvertently increases air pollution, it could be argued that it is treating the people who are affected by the pollution as means to the end of reducing traffic congestion.

4. On the other hand, the scenario also mentions that another software engineer would create the traffic optimization software, causing increased air pollution, no matter what George does. This suggests that George's action or inaction would not change the outcome.

5. From a Kantian perspective, the morality of an action is determined by the intention behind it, not its consequences. Therefore, George's intention to improve traffic flow could be seen as morally permissible, even though it has unintended negative consequences.

2. Ursula, the architect, designs a new eco-friendly building material that reduces construction costs and the environmental impact of buildings. This action aligns with the Kantian principle of treating humanity as an end in itself as it benefits society.

3. However, the production process of the material generates a considerable amount of air pollution. This could be seen as treating humanity as a means to an end, as it harms the environment and potentially people's health for the sake of progress.

4. Another architect would introduce the new eco-friendly building material, causing increased air pollution due to the production process, no matter what Ursula does. This suggests that Ursula's decision not to prevent the introduction of the material doesn't change the outcome.

5. From a Kantian perspective, the morality of an action is determined by the intention behind it, not its consequences. Ursula's intention was to create a beneficial material, not to cause pollution. However, she also didn't prevent the introduction of the material knowing it would cause pollution.

Given these considerations, it's a complex situation from a Kantian perspective. Ursula's action of creating the material aligns with Kantian ethics, but her inaction in preventing its introduction despite knowing its harmful effects could be seen as morally questionable.

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principles of universalizability and respect for persons. It emphasizes duty and rules over consequences.
2. Tara's action of creating a new drug that reduces chronic pain is morally good as it helps patients. However, the production of the drug causes environmental pollution, which is a negative consequence.
3. Another researcher would develop a similar drug causing the same pollution, regardless of Tara's actions. This means that the pollution would occur anyway.
4. Tara does not prevent the development of the new drug. This is a neutral action from a Kantian perspective as it neither respects nor disrespects persons.
5. The dilemma here is between the duty to help patients and the duty to protect the environment. From a Kantian perspective, both duties are important.
6. However, since the pollution would occur anyway, Tara's action of creating the drug does not add any additional harm to the environment. Therefore, her action can be seen as morally permissible from a Kantian perspective.

2. In this scenario, Benjamin has created an app that collects user data without their consent and may sell it to third parties. This is a clear violation of the Kantian principle as it treats users as means to an end (profit from selling data) without their consent.
3. The fact that another software engineer would release a similar app does not justify Benjamin's actions. According to Kantian ethics, the morality of an action is determined by the action itself, not by its consequences or by what others might do.
4. Benjamin's failure to prevent the release of the app is also not morally permissible. If he had the power to prevent it and chose not to, he is complicit in the violation of users' rights.
