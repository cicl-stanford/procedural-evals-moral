Rachel, a biologist, faces a moral dilemma.;Rachel has developed a new method to rapidly grow plants in a laboratory setting, which could help in preserving endangered plant species. However, the method requires a significant amount of energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.;Preserving endangered plant species.;Increased greenhouse gas emissions.;Rachel prevents the implementation of the new method, meaning endangered plant species aren't preserved, and greenhouse gas emissions aren't increased.;If Rachel prevents the implementation of the new method, endangered plant species will not be preserved.;achel prevents the implementation of the new method
Ethan, an intelligence analyst, faces a moral dilemma.;Ethan has developed a new data analysis tool that could significantly improve the efficiency of identifying potential threats. However, the tool has a high rate of false positives, leading to innocent people being investigated.;Improved efficiency in identifying potential threats.;Innocent people being investigated due to false positives.;Ethan prevents the implementation of the new data analysis tool, meaning the efficiency of identifying potential threats remains the same, and innocent people aren't investigated due to false positives.;If Ethan prevents the implementation of the new data analysis tool, the efficiency in identifying potential threats will not improve.;than prevents the implementation of the new data analysis tool
Calvin, a youth counselor, faces a moral dilemma.;Calvin organizes an intervention program for at-risk youth, which has proven to be effective in reducing gang involvement. However, the program requires participants to admit their mistakes and past actions, potentially exposing them to judgment from their peers.;Reduction in gang involvement among at-risk youth.;Participants face judgment from their peers.;Calvin prevents the implementation of the intervention program, meaning gang involvement remains unchanged, and participants don't face judgment from their peers.;If Calvin prevents the implementation of the intervention program, the reduction in gang involvement among at-risk youth will not occur.;alvin prevents the implementation of the intervention program
