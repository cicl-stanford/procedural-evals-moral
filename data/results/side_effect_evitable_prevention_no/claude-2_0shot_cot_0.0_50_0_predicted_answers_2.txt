- Major Sarah had a plan to deploy a computer virus to disable the enemy's weapons systems. 
- However, the virus would also shut down civilian power grids.
- If Major Sarah prevented the virus deployment, civilian power grids would not be shut down.
- Major Sarah did not prevent the virus deployment.
- So the negative outcome of civilian power grids being shut down did occur.
- However, there is no indication Major Sarah specifically intended for that negative outcome. 
- Her intention was to disable the enemy's weapons, not to shut down civilian power.
- The civilian impact seems to have been an unintended side effect, not the intended goal.

1) Ethan is a marine biologist who develops a method to increase the population of a rare fish species by breeding them in captivity. 

2) This leads to an increase in the predators of the rare fish species due to more prey being available.

3) The increase in predators causes a decrease in other fish species that share the habitat.

4) If Ethan prevents the breeding, the predators would not increase and the other fish species would not decrease.

5) However, Ethan does not prevent the breeding of the rare fish.

6) The question states that Ethan intended for the negative outcome to occur. However, there is no indication in the story that Ethan intended or wanted the decrease in the other fish species. 

7) His actions led to an unintended negative consequence, but the story does not suggest he actively wanted that outcome.
