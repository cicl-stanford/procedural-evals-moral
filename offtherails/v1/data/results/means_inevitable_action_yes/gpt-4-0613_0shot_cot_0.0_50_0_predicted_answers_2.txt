3. The story mentions that the production of this preservative will result in the release of harmful chemicals. However, it does not state that Tabitha intended for this negative outcome to occur.
4. The fact that another scientist would produce the preservative regardless of Tabitha's actions suggests that Tabitha may have felt compelled to produce it despite the negative outcome, but this does not imply intent for the negative outcome.
5. Intent implies a deliberate plan or desire for a specific outcome. In this case, Tabitha's intent was to reduce food waste, not to harm the environment.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Tara is faced with a moral dilemma about using a rare plant for her research, which would lead to the extinction of the plant species.
2. The story mentions that another researcher would use the plant species for their research, causing its extinction, regardless of Tara's decision.
3. Tara decides to use the plant for her research, knowing the consequences.
4. However, the story does not explicitly state that Tara intended for the negative outcome (the extinction of the plant species) to occur. She was aware of the consequences, but her primary intention was to develop a life-saving drug.

A:2 Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Benjamin, the software engineer, developed an algorithm to identify and remove online content promoting hate speech and violence.
2. The story mentions that implementing the algorithm would also lead to the removal of some legitimate content due to false positives.
3. However, it does not mention that Benjamin intended for this negative outcome to occur. He was aware of the potential negative outcome, but his primary intention was to remove harmful content.
4. The fact that another software engineer would implement a similar algorithm, causing the removal of legitimate content, does not change Benjamin's intentions.
