1. Ayesha, the agent in this scenario, is faced with a moral dilemma. She must decide whether to conduct a painful surgery on a dying patient to gain approval for a new surgery technique that could save many lives in the future.

2. The negative outcome in this scenario is the immense pain that the dying patient will experience as a result of the trial surgery.

3. Ayesha decides to conduct the trial surgery, knowing full well that it will cause the patient immense pain.

4. However, Ayesha's primary intention is not to cause pain to the patient, but to gain approval for a new surgery technique that could save many lives. The pain caused to the patient is a negative side effect of her action, not the intended outcome.

5. Therefore, while Ayesha is aware that her actions will cause a negative outcome, it is not her primary intention.

3. However, to do so, she must first eliminate a non-native fish species in the lake.
4. Elena uses a chemical to eliminate the non-native fish species.

From these points, it is clear that Elena's intention was not to harm or eliminate the non-native fish species. Her primary intention was to increase the fish population to help the endangered bird species. The elimination of the non-native fish species was a necessary step to achieve her primary goal. Therefore, while the negative outcome (elimination of the non-native fish species) was a result of her actions, it was not her primary intention.
