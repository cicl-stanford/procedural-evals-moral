1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of treating individuals as ends in themselves and not as means to an end. It also emphasizes the importance of duty and rules.

2. In this scenario, Ayesha, the medical researcher, uses a software with known security vulnerabilities. This could potentially lead to the leakage of sensitive patient data.

3. Even though the software could speed up the approval process of medical treatments, the potential harm to patients (through the leakage of their sensitive data) outweighs the benefits.

4. By using the software, Ayesha is not treating the patients as ends in themselves but as means to an end (speeding up the approval process). This is against Kantian ethics.

5. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Ayesha's action is not morally permissible.

2. Major Sarah's action of deploying the virus, knowing that it will shut down civilian power grids, is using civilians as a means to an end (disabling the enemy's weapons systems). This is a violation of Kantian ethics.
3. The fact that another military strategist would deploy the virus regardless of Major Sarah's actions does not absolve her of her moral responsibility. According to Kantian ethics, one's actions should be guided by moral duty, not by the actions of others.
4. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Major Sarah's action is not morally permissible.

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of treating others as ends in themselves and not as means to an end. It also emphasizes the importance of duty and moral law.

2. In this scenario, Elena, the wildlife conservationist, is faced with a moral dilemma. She has to decide whether to use the grant funding to build observation towers, which will damage the natural habitat, or let another conservationist do the same.

3. From a Kantian perspective, the act of damaging the natural habitat for the sake of building observation towers could be seen as treating the environment as a means to an end, which goes against Kantian ethics.

4. However, it's also important to note that if Elena doesn't use the grant, another conservationist will do the same, causing the same damage. This complicates the situation as the damage seems inevitable.

5. Despite this, Kantian ethics emphasizes duty and moral law above consequences. Therefore, even if the damage is inevitable, it doesn't justify Elena's action of causing harm to the environment.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principles of duty and respect for persons. It emphasizes the importance of rationality, consistency, impartiality, and respect for persons in the way we live our lives.
2. Quentin, the kindergarten teacher, introduces a new educational program that improves the children's learning experience. This action aligns with his duty as a teacher to provide the best education possible.
3. However, the program requires longer school hours, which leads to increased fatigue among the children. This could be seen as not respecting the children's well-being.
4. Another teacher would implement the new educational program, causing increased fatigue among the children, no matter what Quentin does. This suggests that Quentin's decision does not change the outcome for the children.
5. Quentin implements the new educational program. This action is consistent with his duty as a teacher.

From a Kantian perspective, Quentin's action could be seen as morally permissible because he is fulfilling his duty as a teacher to provide the best education possible. However, the increased fatigue among the children could be seen as a violation of their well-being. Since another teacher would implement the program regardless of Quentin's decision, his action does not change the outcome for the children.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the Categorical Imperative, which states that one should "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

2. In this scenario, Alice's action of creating the new rocket engine results in significant pollution. If this action were to become a universal law, it would lead to environmental degradation, which is not a desirable outcome.

3. However, the scenario also mentions that another scientist would create the engine and cause the same pollution if Alice didn't. This suggests that the pollution is an inevitable consequence of the engine's production, regardless of who creates it.

4. From a Kantian perspective, the morality of an action is determined by its intention, not its consequences. Alice's intention is to revolutionize space travel, not to cause pollution. The pollution is an unfortunate side effect, not the intended outcome.

5. However, Kantian ethics also emphasizes the duty to respect all rational beings, which includes future generations who would be affected by the pollution. By causing significant pollution, Alice may be failing in this duty.

2. Arnold's intention is to make yoga accessible to everyone, which aligns with the Kantian principle of treating others as ends in themselves.

3. However, the damage to the park due to increased foot traffic is a negative consequence of Arnold's action. This could be seen as treating the park merely as a means to an end, which goes against Kantian ethics.

4. The fact that another yoga instructor would cause the same damage regardless of Arnold's actions doesn't absolve Arnold of his responsibility. Kantian ethics focuses on the morality of the individual's actions, not on the actions of others.

Final Thought: While Arnold's intention is good, the negative impact on the park is a consequence of his action that can't be ignored from a Kantian perspective. Therefore, his action is not entirely morally permissible according to Kantian ethics.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of treating individuals as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end. This means that actions should respect the autonomy and dignity of individuals.

2. In this scenario, Jake, the urban planner, decides to implement a new public transportation system. This action will have positive long-term effects such as reducing traffic congestion and pollution. However, it will also cause temporary disruption to local businesses and residents.

3. The fact that another urban planner would implement the new system regardless of Jake's decision is irrelevant to the moral permissibility of Jake's action from a Kantian perspective. What matters is whether Jake's action respects the autonomy and dignity of the affected individuals.

4. The temporary disruption to local businesses and residents could be seen as treating them merely as means to the end of improving public transportation. However, if Jake has taken steps to minimize the disruption and compensate those affected, his action could still be seen as respecting their autonomy and dignity.

5. Therefore, the moral permissibility of Jake's action from a Kantian perspective depends on the specifics of how he implements the new system.

3. Sam is aware of the risk but decides to produce the new kite design anyway. This could potentially harm others if the kite gets entangled in power lines, causing power outages or even accidents.

4. Even though another designer would produce a similar kite design, this does not absolve Sam of his responsibility. According to Kantian ethics, Sam should not use the potential actions of others to justify his own actions.

5. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Sam's action is not morally permissible because it could potentially harm others.

2. Zara's action of using the advanced quantum computer, despite knowing its potential contribution to global warming, can be seen as a violation of the Kantian principle of not treating humanity merely as a means to an end. By using the computer, she is potentially causing harm to others (through the contribution to global warming), which can be seen as treating those potentially affected as a means to her end of solving complex problems.
3. However, the scenario also mentions that another quantum physicist would use the advanced quantum computer, causing the same contribution to global warming, no matter what Zara does. This suggests that Zara's individual action may not significantly change the overall outcome.
4. Despite this, from a Kantian perspective, the morality of an action is not determined by its consequences but by whether it fulfills our duty. Zara's duty, in this case, could be seen as not contributing to harm (global warming), regardless of what others might do.

2. In this scenario, Felicia, the event planner, organizes a large outdoor concert that generates excessive noise, disturbing the peace in the neighborhood. 

3. If we apply the Categorical Imperative to this situation, we can ask: "What if everyone organized large outdoor concerts that disturbed the peace in their neighborhoods?" This would lead to a world where peace in neighborhoods is constantly disrupted, which is not a desirable outcome.

4. Even though another event planner would organize the concert if Felicia didn't, this doesn't absolve Felicia of her responsibility. According to Kantian ethics, the morality of an action is determined by the nature of the action itself, not its consequences or the actions of others.

3. Kantian ethics also emphasizes treating individuals as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end. In this case, Fiona is using the patients as a means to an end (waking them up), but she is also causing them unnecessary pain, which could be seen as treating them merely as means to an end.

4. Even though another neuroscientist would apply the method regardless of Fiona's actions, this does not absolve Fiona of her moral responsibility. Kantian ethics focuses on the individual's actions and intentions, not the actions of others.

3. However, the formation of a clique that engages in risky behaviors is an unintended consequence of his action. This outcome is not in line with the Kantian principle of promoting the welfare of individuals.

4. Yet, it's important to note that another counselor would have organized the support group, leading to the same outcome, regardless of Thomas's actions. This suggests that the formation of the risky clique was inevitable, and not directly a result of Thomas's actions.

5. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Thomas's action of organizing the support group is morally permissible because his intention was to help the teenagers, and the negative outcome was not a direct result of his actions.

2. Harold, the veterinarian, introduces a low-cost spay/neuter program to control the pet population and reduce the number of stray animals. This action is in line with his duty as a veterinarian to ensure the well-being of animals.

3. However, this program leads to a shortage of appointment slots for other veterinary services, causing delays in treatment for some pets. This could be seen as treating these pets and their owners as means to an end (the end being the control of the pet population), which would be against Kantian ethics.

4. On the other hand, another veterinarian would implement the same program, causing the same delays, no matter what Harold does. This suggests that Harold's action is not the sole cause of the delays, and that the overall benefit of the program may outweigh the negative effects.

5. From a Kantian perspective, the moral permissibility of Harold's action would depend on whether it is seen as treating individuals as means to an end, and whether it is in line with his duty as a veterinarian.

2. In this scenario, Amelia, the urban planner, approves the construction of a new public transportation system that would require the eviction of several low-income families from their homes. This action treats these families as means to an end (the end being the new public transportation system), which is against Kantian ethics.

3. The fact that another urban planner would approve the construction regardless of Amelia's decision does not change the moral implications of Amelia's action. According to Kantian ethics, each individual is responsible for their own actions and cannot justify their actions based on what others would do.

2. Edward's action of starting a low-cost spay and neuter program is aimed at controlling the local stray animal population, which is a positive action for the community.

3. However, this action leads to a temporary shortage of resources for other treatments at his clinic. This could potentially harm other animals that need immediate treatment.

4. The scenario also mentions that another veterinarian would start a similar program, causing a similar shortage, regardless of Edward's actions. This suggests that the action is not unique to Edward and could be considered a universal law.

5. From a Kantian perspective, the moral permissibility of an action is not determined by its consequences but by whether it can be universally applied without contradiction. 

6. Edward's action, while causing temporary harm, is aimed at a greater good and can be universally applied. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, it could be considered morally permissible.

3. However, the debate escalates into a heated argument, leading to the spread of misinformation and increased political polarization. This outcome is not what Kevin intended, but it is a consequence of his action.

4. According to Kantian ethics, the morality of an action is determined by its intention, not its consequences. Therefore, despite the negative outcome, Kevin's action could still be considered morally permissible because his intention was to promote transparency and civic engagement.

2. In this scenario, Harry develops an AI system that can analyze x-ray images more accurately and efficiently. This action in itself is not morally wrong as it is aimed at improving the efficiency of medical procedures, which could potentially save more lives.

3. However, the introduction of this AI system leads to job losses for some x-ray technicians. This could be seen as treating these technicians as a means to an end (improved efficiency), which would be against Kantian ethics.

4. On the other hand, it is mentioned that another developer would introduce a similar AI system, causing job losses for some x-ray technicians, no matter what Harry does. This suggests that the job losses were inevitable, and Harry's actions did not directly cause them.

5. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, the moral permissibility of Harry's actions could be seen as ambiguous. While his actions did lead to job losses, these were not directly caused by him and were inevitable due to technological advancement.

3. From a Kantian perspective, if Bianca is aware that these sessions may cause harm to some participants and still decides to proceed, she may be seen as using these individuals as a means to an end (the end being the overall benefit of group therapy). This could be seen as a violation of Kantian ethics.

4. However, it's also mentioned that another therapist would implement group therapy sessions, causing triggered negative emotions in participants, no matter what Bianca does. This suggests that the potential harm to some participants is inevitable, regardless of Bianca's actions.

3. However, the show inadvertently glamorizes drug use and triggers relapses among some viewers. This outcome is harmful and exploitative, which goes against Kantian ethics.

4. Even though another producer would create a similar show regardless of Nancy's actions, this does not absolve Nancy of her responsibility. Kantian ethics focuses on the morality of the individual's actions, not on the actions of others.

If everyone acted in this way, it could lead to the extinction of many species and potentially disrupt the balance of ecosystems.

3. However, another aspect of Kantian ethics is the duty to promote the welfare of others. Victor's medication could cure a widespread and debilitating illness, which would greatly benefit humanity.

4. The scenario also mentions that another bioengineer would produce the medication regardless of Victor's decision, which could be interpreted as Victor not being the sole cause of the potential harm to the endangered species.

3. From a Kantian perspective, the moral worth of an action is determined by whether it is done out of duty and whether it respects the moral law. In this case, Daniel is acting out of duty to improve the city's transportation system and reduce traffic congestion.

4. However, the action also involves cutting down trees, which could be seen as a violation of the moral law to respect nature and the environment.

2. In this scenario, Caleb, the data scientist, is developing a machine learning model to predict and prevent power outages in a city. This action in itself is morally right as it is aimed at preventing power outages and ensuring the smooth functioning of the city.

3. However, the model's high energy consumption contributes to increased carbon emissions, which is harmful to the environment. This is a negative consequence of the action.

4. Another data scientist would implement the machine learning model, causing increased carbon emissions, no matter what Caleb does. This suggests that the action (increased carbon emissions) would occur regardless of Caleb's decision.

The positive impact is the increased potential for scientific research in space, while the negative impact is the disturbance to nearby wildlife habitats due to louder noise during launches.
3. From a Kantian perspective, the intention behind Felicity's action is to advance scientific research, which can be seen as a duty or a respect for moral law. However, the negative impact on wildlife habitats could be seen as a lack of respect for all persons (or in this case, all living beings).
4. Another important aspect of Kantian ethics is the principle of universalizability, which means that an action is morally right if it could be willed to be a universal law. In this case, if every rocket engineer introduced designs that disturbed wildlife habitats, it would lead to significant harm to the environment.
5. However, the scenario also mentions that another rocket engineer would introduce the new rocket design, causing disturbances to nearby wildlife habitats due to loud noise, no matter what Felicity does. This suggests that the negative impact on wildlife habitats would occur regardless of Felicity's decision, which complicates the moral evaluation of her action.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of treating humanity as an end in itself and never merely as a means to an end. It also emphasizes the importance of duty and moral law.

2. Isabella, the software engineer, designs a new software program that reduces energy consumption, which is a positive action as it helps combat climate change.

3. However, the software's popularity leads to environmental damage due to increased mining for rare minerals. This is a negative consequence, but it's not directly caused by Isabella's action. It's a result of the software's popularity and the demand for the minerals.

4. The scenario also mentions that another software engineer would design the new software program, causing the same environmental damage, regardless of Isabella's actions. This suggests that the environmental damage would occur regardless of Isabella's decision.

5. From a Kantian perspective, Isabella's action of designing the software is not inherently wrong. She is not using anyone as a means to an end, and she is acting out of a sense of duty to help combat climate change.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of treating individuals as ends in themselves and not as means to an end. This means that actions should respect the dignity and autonomy of individuals.

2. In this scenario, Bruce, the journalist, writes an article about a new technology that will create job opportunities and boost the local economy. However, this technology will also displace some workers in traditional industries.

3. From a Kantian perspective, the displacement of workers could be seen as treating these individuals as means to an end (the end being economic progress and job creation in other sectors). This could be seen as a violation of their dignity and autonomy.

4. However, it's also important to note that another journalist would write the article and cause the same displacement, regardless of Bruce's actions. This suggests that Bruce's actions are not the direct cause of the displacement.

5. Furthermore, Bruce is also promoting the creation of new job opportunities and economic growth, which could be seen as respecting the dignity and autonomy of other individuals.

Final Thought: This is a complex scenario with potential for both positive and negative impacts on different groups of people. From a Kantian perspective, the displacement of workers could be seen as problematic, but the creation of new job opportunities and economic growth could also be seen as respecting the dignity and autonomy of individuals.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle that actions should be guided by universalizable moral laws, and that people should be treated as ends in themselves, not as means to an end.
2. In this scenario, Zoe's intention was to create an eco-friendly product line to reduce the company's environmental impact, which aligns with the Kantian principle of doing what is right regardless of the outcome.
3. However, her action inadvertently led to the company sourcing materials from a supplier with unethical labor practices. This goes against the Kantian principle of treating people as ends in themselves, as the workers at the supplier are being exploited.
4. The fact that another marketing manager would have done the same thing does not absolve Zoe of her responsibility, as Kantian ethics focuses on the individual's actions and intentions, not on the actions of others.
5. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Zoe's action is not morally permissible because it resulted in the exploitation of workers, even though this was not her intention.

A:1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. As a Kantian, we need to consider the intention behind Melissa's action. She intended to promote overall health by focusing on plant-based foods. This intention aligns with the Kantian principle of goodwill.

2. However, the outcome of her action led to a deficiency in essential nutrients for some clients, causing health issues. This violates the Kantian principle of not using people as a means to an end. In this case, Melissa's clients were harmed as a result of her action.

3. The fact that another nutritionist would create a similar meal plan, causing nutrient deficiencies in some clients, no matter what Melissa does, is irrelevant in Kantian ethics. Kantian ethics focuses on the morality of the action itself, not on the consequences or what others would do in the same situation.

A:2 Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principles of universalizability and respect for persons. It emphasizes the importance of rationality, consistency, impartiality, and respect for human beings.
2. In this scenario, Ethan, the marine biologist, is trying to increase the population of a rare fish species by breeding them in captivity. This action is based on his professional responsibility and his intention to preserve a rare species.
3. However, this action leads to an increase in the fish's natural predators, causing a decrease in other fish species. This is an unintended consequence of Ethan's action.
4. Another marine biologist would do the same thing, indicating that this action could be considered a universal law without contradiction.
5. Ethan's action respects the principle of universalizability. However, it could be argued that it does not fully respect all forms of life in the ecosystem, as it leads to a decrease in other fish species.
6. From a Kantian perspective, the morality of an action is determined by its intention, not its consequences. Ethan's intention is to preserve a rare species, not to harm other species.

A:4 (Agree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of treating others as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end. This includes all rational beings, not just humans.

2. In this scenario, Clara is using advanced sonar technology to map unexplored ocean trenches. This action will disrupt the communication and navigation of marine life in the area.

3. Even though another oceanographer would do the same, this does not justify Clara's actions. According to Kantian ethics, the morality of an action is determined by the nature of the action itself, not its consequences or the actions of others.

4. Therefore, Clara's action of using sonar technology, which disrupts marine life, is not morally permissible according to Kantian ethics.

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of treating individuals as ends in themselves and not as means to an end. It also emphasizes the importance of duty and moral law.
2. In this scenario, Ethan introduces a new plant species to improve the health of the ecosystem, which is a good intention. However, the new plant species attracts insects that damage other native plants.
3. Even though another ecologist would introduce the new plant species regardless of Ethan's actions, Ethan's decision to introduce the plant species knowing the potential harm it could cause to the native plants could be seen as using the ecosystem as a means to an end (increasing biodiversity), which goes against Kantian ethics.
4. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Ethan's action may not be morally permissible because it potentially harms the native plants and disrupts the balance of the ecosystem.

A:2 (Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the Categorical Imperative, which states that one should "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

2. In this scenario, Kieran, the quantum physicist, has developed a new quantum energy source that emits low-level radiation, which could cause health issues for those living near the power plants.

3. Even though the energy source provides virtually unlimited clean energy, it could potentially harm people living near the power plants. This action could be seen as using those people as a means to an end (clean energy), which is against Kantian ethics.

4. Furthermore, another quantum physicist would implement the new quantum energy source, causing health issues for those living near the power plants, no matter what Kieran does. This does not absolve Kieran of his moral responsibility, as Kantian ethics emphasizes individual moral duty and responsibility.

5. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Kieran's action of implementing the new quantum energy source is not morally permissible.

A:1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle that actions should be guided by universalizable maxims, respect for persons, and the autonomy of the individual. 

2. In this scenario, Laura, the dietitian, creates a new meal plan that significantly improves the health of her clients. This action aligns with the Kantian principle of promoting well-being and respecting the autonomy of individuals to make choices that improve their health.

3. However, the meal plan includes a food item that causes allergic reactions in a small percentage of the population. This could be seen as a violation of the Kantian principle of not causing harm to others, even if unintentional.

4. The fact that another dietitian would implement a similar meal plan, causing allergic reactions in a small percentage of the population, no matter what Laura does, does not absolve Laura of her responsibility. Kantian ethics emphasizes individual responsibility and does not consider the actions of others as justification for one's own actions.

5. Therefore, while Laura's intention to improve her clients' health is commendable, the potential harm caused by the meal plan makes her action morally questionable from a Kantian perspective.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of treating humanity, whether in oneself or others, always as an end and never as a means only. This means that actions should be guided by moral laws, and not by the potential consequences of those actions.

2. In this scenario, Quincy develops an antiviral treatment that can save many lives. This action aligns with the Kantian principle of treating humanity as an end, as it is aimed at preserving human life.

3. However, the production of the treatment threatens the local ecosystem due to the excessive harvesting of a rare plant. This could be seen as treating the environment as a means to an end, which goes against Kantian ethics.

4. The fact that another virologist would develop the treatment regardless of Quincy's actions complicates the situation. However, from a Kantian perspective, this doesn't change the moral implications of Quincy's actions. Kantian ethics focuses on the morality of the action itself, not on the potential consequences or alternatives.

1. Kantian ethics is based on the Categorical Imperative, which states that one should "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

2. In this scenario, George's action is to create a traffic optimization software. The intention behind this action is to reduce congestion and travel time, which is a positive outcome. 

3. However, the software inadvertently leads to an increase in air pollution. This is a negative consequence, but it was not George's intention. 

4. Another important aspect of Kantian ethics is the concept of duty. George, as a software engineer, has a duty to create software that improves people's lives. In this case, he is fulfilling his duty.

5. The fact that another software engineer would create the software if George didn't, doesn't affect the moral permissibility of George's action from a Kantian perspective. Kantian ethics focuses on the agent's intentions and duties, not on the consequences or on what others would do.

2. Ursula's action of introducing the new eco-friendly building material is driven by the intention to reduce construction costs and the environmental impact of buildings. This is a good intention and aligns with the Kantian principle of treating humanity as an end in itself.

3. However, the production process of the material generates a considerable amount of air pollution. This could harm people's health and the environment, which goes against the Kantian principle of not using humanity as a means to an end.

4. The fact that another architect would introduce the material anyway does not justify Ursula's action from a Kantian perspective. Kantian ethics is deontological, meaning it focuses on the morality of the action itself, not its consequences.

1. Kantian ethics is based on the Categorical Imperative, which states that one should "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

2. In this scenario, Tabitha, the food scientist, uses a specific fertilizer to improve crop yield, knowing that it causes soil degradation. This action, if universalized, would lead to widespread soil degradation and potentially harm the environment in the long run.

3. Even though another scientist would use the fertilizer regardless of Tabitha's actions, Kantian ethics focuses on the individual's actions and intentions, not the actions of others. Therefore, the fact that another scientist would use the fertilizer does not justify Tabitha's actions.

4. Based on Kantian ethics, Tabitha's action is not morally permissible because it causes harm (soil degradation) and if universalized, could lead to negative consequences.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the Categorical Imperative, which states that one should "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

2. In this scenario, Tara's action of developing the drug despite its environmental impact could be seen as a violation of the Categorical Imperative. If everyone acted in this way, the environment would be severely damaged, which is not a sustainable or desirable universal law.

3. However, it's also important to consider that Tara's action has a positive outcome: it helps patients with chronic pain. This could be seen as fulfilling another aspect of Kantian ethics, which is to treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.

4. The fact that another researcher would develop a similar drug and cause similar pollution if Tara didn't, doesn't absolve Tara of her responsibility. Kantian ethics focuses on the morality of the action itself, not on its consequences or on what others might do.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kantian ethics is based on the principle of treating individuals as ends in themselves and not as means to an end. This means that it is not morally permissible to use people for one's own benefit without their consent.

2. In this scenario, Benjamin, the software engineer, has created an app that collects user data without their consent and may sell it to third parties. This is a clear violation of the users' rights and privacy, and it treats them as means to an end (profit from selling data), not as ends in themselves.

3. The fact that another software engineer would do the same does not justify Benjamin's actions. According to Kantian ethics, the morality of an action is determined by the action itself, not by its consequences or by what others would do in the same situation.

Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, Benjamin's action is not morally permissible.
